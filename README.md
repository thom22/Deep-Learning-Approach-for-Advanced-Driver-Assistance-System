# Deep-Learning-Approach-for-Advanced-Driver-Assistance-System [국책 과제/National Project, South Korea]

In this project **a hybrid deep learning** tool is utilized to detect up to nine various distracted driver activities including **driving, drinking, texting, smoking, talking with rising hands, adjusting the navigation system, looking outside, nodding off to sleep, fainting** inside a real vehicle cabin during the **daytime and nighttime** conditions. The developed model is integrated with an alert system in a real vehicles and tested to give a real-time warning system when the drivers engage in distraction activities while driving.
